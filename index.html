        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <hr class="section-hr">
        <h3>My Background</h3>
        <p>I am 28 years old and I am originally from Columbus, Ohio. In the U.S. I earned my Bachelor's in Criminal Justice
          and my Master's in Criminology. During my education, I worked various jobs relating to my field including a year
          as a private police officer working in residential areas. In 2013, my life quickly changed after I met my wife,
          Mirjam. My wife is originally from Sweden, and after I became engaged to her I moved to Gothenburg. Since arriving
          in Sweden, I have studied Swedish up to the SAS-Grund level. I also worked for a year as an English teacher with
          preschool and kindergarten students who came from English speaking families.</p>
        <h3>Change in Career</h3>
        <p>Finding work in Criminology has not been easy in Sweden for various reasons. As a result, I have decided to switch
          career paths. However, I am very excited for this change in direction. Computers, networking, and to a certain
          extent programming have always been passions of mine, but I did not pursue a career in the IT field due to job
          insecurity in that area at the time. Since I am able to receive free education in Sweden, I plan to make the most
          of it by reeducating myself for a career as a front-end web developer. </p>
        <h3>Career Goals</h3>
        <p>Currently I am studying Front-End JavaScript Development at Lernia. In this program, we will be learning HTML5, CSS3,
          JavaScript, Angular, Express, Node and other related technologies. After finishing my education with Lernia, I
          hope to find work as a front-end developer but I also have great interest in eventually working with back-end JavaScript
          programming. With time, I hope to transition into working in more of a full stack development capacity. I am extremely
          interested in both Linux and the open source community as whole. I think it would be very exciting to eventually
          learn Linux server administration to further my ability to work with back-end web technologies. </p>
